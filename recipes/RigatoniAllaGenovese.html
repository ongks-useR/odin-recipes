        <p>
            To many Neapolitans, the beef sauce La Genovese is at the heart of the city's cooking. Yet it’s little more
            than
            onions (lots of them) and beef, simmered until both fall apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boiling the onions before cooking is a variation on traditional technique and could be considered a
            shortcut; it
            does save time, though not a whole lot of it. It's easy enough, and more traditional, to slice the onions
            raw
            and increase cooking time accordingly.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>
                Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook pancetta until most of fat is rendered out, about 6
                minutes. Remove cooked pancetta with a slotted spoon and save.
            </p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>
                Raise heat to high and transfer meat to the pot. Season with salt. Cook and stir until liquid releases
                from beef and begins to evaporate, and meat browns, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>
                Reduce heat to medium-high. Add celery, carrots, reserved cooked pancetta, salt and pepper. Cook and
                stir about 5 minutes. Add a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste, bay leaf, and white wine. Cook and stir,
                scraping up the brownings from the bottom of the pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sliced onions. Reduce heat to
                medium. Cover pot and cook 30 minutes without stirring. After 30 minutes, stir onions and meat until
                well mixed. Cover again, and cook another 30 minutes. Stir.
            </p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>
                Reduce heat to low and cook uncovered 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally. Skim off fat as mixture
                cooks. If sauce seems to reduce too much, add water or broth as needed to maintain a sauce-like
                consistency. Cook until beef and onions seem to melt into each other.
            </p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally until just barely al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
            </p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>
                Add rigatoni to the sauce and cook until heated through. Serve topped with a pinch of marjoram and
                freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
